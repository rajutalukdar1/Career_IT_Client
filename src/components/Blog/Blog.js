                        <p className="px-4 py-6 pt-0 ml-4 -mt-4 dark:text-gray-400">Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-based security mechanism controlled and enforced by the client (web browser). It allows a service (API) to indicate any origin other than its own from which the client can request resources. It has been designed in response to the same-origin policy (SOP) that restricts how a website (HTML document or JS script) loaded by one origin can interact with a resource from another origin. CORS is used to explicitly allow some cross-origin requests while rejecting others. </p>

                        <p className="px-4 py-6 pt-0 ml-4 -mt-4 dark:text-gray-400">Firebase helps you develop high-quality apps, grow your user base, and earn more money. Each feature works independently, and they work even better together. &&& Usually, authentication by a server entails the use of a user name and password. Other ways to authenticate can be through cards, retina scans, voice recognition, and fingerprints. </p>

                        <p className="px-4 py-6 pt-0 ml-4 -mt-4 dark:text-gray-400">The private route component is similar to the public route, the only change is that redirect URL and authenticate condition. If the user is not authenticated he will be redirected to the login page and the user can only access the authenticated routes If he is authenticated (Logged in).</p>

                        <p className="px-4 py-6 pt-0 ml-4 -mt-4 dark:text-gray-400">It was merely a webserver, an alternative to Apache and other "blocking" servers. But the project soon grew beyond his initial webserver library, expanding into a framework that could be used to build, well, almost anything. So he rechristened it node.&&& It is a used as backend service where javascript works on the server-side of the application. This way javascript is used on both frontend and backend. Node. js runs on chrome v8 engine which converts javascript code into machine code, it is highly scalable, lightweight, fast, and data-intensive. </p>
